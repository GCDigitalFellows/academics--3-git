## Why Learn Git?

- Naming a new version of a document gets tiresome when you end up with
  something like "JournalArticle_V1_Aug31_DRAFT_FINAL.docx"
- Git is a distributed version control system
- Useful for programs *and* prose
- Made for collaborative projects 
- Also great for personal projects

  an educational discount](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new) to get unlimited private repositories for free

- If you don't already have a text editor, install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
